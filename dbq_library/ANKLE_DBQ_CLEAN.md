SECTION II - MEDICAL HISTORY
2A. Describe the history, including onset and course, of the Veteran's ankle condition(s). Brief summary:
2B. Does the Veteran report flare-ups of the ankle?
Yes
No

If yes, document the Veteran's description of the flare-ups he/she experiences, including the frequency, duration, characteristics, precipitating and alleviating factors,

severity, and/or extent of functional impairment he/she experiences during a flare-up of symptoms:

2C. Does the Veteran report having any functional loss or functional impairment of the joint or extremity being evaluated on this questionnaire, including but not

limited to after repeated use over time?
Yes
No

If yes, document the Veteran's description of functional loss or functional impairment in his/her own words:
2D. Does the Veteran report or have a history of instability of the ankle?
Yes
No

If yes, document the Veteran's description of instability in his/her own words:
SECTION III - RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION
There are several separate parameters requested for describing function of a joint. The question "Does this ROM contribute to a functional loss?" asks if there is a

functional loss that can be ascribed to any documented loss of range of motion; and, unlike later questions, does not take into account the numerous other factors to

be considered. Subsequent questions take into account additional factors such as pain, fatigue, weakness, lack of endurance, or incoordination. If there is pain noted

on examination, it is important to understand whether or not that pain itself contributes to functional loss. Ideally, a claimant would be seen immediately after repetitive

use over time or during a flare-up; however, this is not always feasible.
Information regarding joint function on repetitive use is broken up into two subsets. The first subset is based on observed repetitive use, and the second is based on

functional loss associated with repeated use over time. The observed repetitive use section initially asks for objective findings after three or more repetitions of range

of motion testing. The second subset provides a more global picture of functional loss associated with repetitive use over time. The latter takes into account medical

probability of additional functional loss as a global view. This takes into account not only the objective findings noted on the examination, but also the subjective

history provided by the claimant, as well as review of the available medical evidence.
Optimally, a description of any additional loss of function should be provided - such as what the degrees of range of motion would be opined to look like after

repetitive use over time. However, when this is not feasible, an "as clear as possible" description of that loss should be provided. This same information (minus the

three repetitions) is asked to be provided with regards to flare-ups.

SECTION XI - REMAINING EFFECTIVE FUNCTION OF THE EXTREMITIES
Note: The intention of this section is to permit the examiner to quantify the level of remaining function; it is not intended to inquire whether the Veteran should undergo

an amputation with fitting of a prosthesis. For example, if the functions of grasping (hand) or propulsion (foot) are as limited as if the Veteran had an amputation and

prosthesis, the examiner should check "yes" and describe the diminished functioning. The question simply asks whether the functional loss is to the same degree as

if there were an amputation of the affected limb.
11A. Due to the Veterans ankle condition(s), is there functional impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other than that which would be

equally well served by an amputation with prosthesis (functions of the lower extremity include balance and propulsion, etc.)?
Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prothesis would equally serve the Veteran.
No

If yes, indicate extremities for which this applies:
Right lower
Left lower

11B. For each checked extremity, identify the condition causing loss of function, describe loss of effective function and provide specific examples (brief summary):

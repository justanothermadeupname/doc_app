Undernutrition (see Note 3)
Substantial weight loss (see Note 4)
Note 3: "UndernutritionÓ means a deficiency resulting from insufficient intake of one or multiple

essential nutrients, or the inability of the body to absorb, utilize, or retain such nutrients.

Undernutrition is characterized by failure of the body to maintain normal organ functions and

healthy tissues. Signs and symptoms may include: loss of subcutaneous tissue, edema,

peripheral neuropathy, muscle wasting, weakness, abdominal distention, ascites, and Body

Mass Index below normal range.

Note 4: ÒSubstantial weight lossÓ means involuntary loss greater than 20 percent of an

individual's baseline weight sustained for three months with diminished quality of self-care or

work tasks. "Baseline weightÓ means the clinically documented average weight for the two-year

period preceding the onset of illness or, if relevant, the weight recorded at the Veteran's most

recent discharge physical. If neither of these weights is available or currently relevant, then use

ideal body weight as determined by either the Hamwi formula or Body Mass Index tables,

whichever is most favorable to the Veteran.

section?
Yes
No

(If "Yes," describe (brief summary)):
5B. Does the Veteran have any scars (surgical or otherwise) related to any conditions or to the treatment of any conditions listed in the diagnosis section?
Yes
No
If "Yes," also complete the appropriate dermatological questionnaire.
5C. Comments, if any:
SECTION VI - MENTAL HEALTH MANIFESTATIONS DUE TO ALS OR ITS TREATMENT
6A. Does the Veteran have depression, cognitive impairment or dementia, or any other mental disorder attributable to ALS and/or its treatment?
Yes
No

(If "Yes," ALSO complete the Mental Disorders Disability Benefits Questionnaire (schedule with appropriate provider))
SECTION VII - HOUSEBOUND

Yes
No

(If "Yes," describe how often per day or week and under what circumstances the Veteran is able to leave the home or immediate premises):



SECTION VIII - AID AND ATTENDANCE
Note: Responses in this section should only relate to impairments or limitations that are due to ALS.
8A. Is the Veteran able to dress or undress him or herself without assistance?
Yes
No

8B. Does the Veteran have sufficient upper extremity coordination and strength to be able to feed him or herself without assistance?
Yes
No

8C. Is the Veteran able to attend to the wants of nature (toileting) without assistance?
Yes
No

8D. Is the Veteran able to bathe him or herself without assistance?
Yes
No

8E. Is the Veteran able to keep him or herself ordinarily clean and presentable without assistance?
Yes
No

8F. Does the Veteran need frequent assistance for adjustment of any special prosthetic or orthopedic appliance(s)
Yes
No

(If "Yes," describe):
Note: For VA purposes, "bedridden" will be that condition which actually requires that the claimant remain in bed. The fact that claimant has voluntarily taken to bed

or that a physician has prescribed rest in bed for the greater or lesser part of the day to promote convalescence or cure will not suffice.
8G. Is the Veteran bedridden?
Yes
No

8H. Does the Veteran require care and/or assistance on a regular basis due to his or her physical and/or mental disabilities in order to protect him or herself from the

hazards and/or dangers incident to his or her daily environment?
Yes
No

8I. List any condition(s), in addition to the Veteran's ALS, that causes any of the above limitations:
SECTION IX - NEED FOR HIGHER LEVEL (i.e., more skilled) AID & ATTENDANCE (A&A)
9A. Does the Veteran require a higher, more skilled level of A&A?
Yes
No

Note: For VA purposes, this skilled, higher level care includes (but is not limited to) health-care services such as physical therapy, administration of injections,

placement of indwelling catheters, changing of sterile dressings, and/or like functions which require professional health-care training or the regular supervision of a

trained health-care professional to perform. In the absence of this higher level of care provided in the home, the Veteran would require hospitalization, nursing home

care, or other residential institutional care.

SECTION X - ASSISTIVE DEVICES
10A. Does the Veteran use any assistive device(s) as a normal mode of locomotion, although occasional locomotion by other methods may be possible?
Yes
No

(If "Yes," identify assistive device(s) used (check all that apply and indicate frequency)):

Wheelchair
Frequency of use:
occasional
regular
constant

Brace(s)
Frequency of use:
occasional
regular

10B. If the Veteran uses any assistive devices, specify the condition and identify the assistive device used for each condition:
SECTION XI - REMAINING EFFECTIVE FUNCTION OF THE EXTREMITIES
Note: The intention of this section is to permit the examiner to quantify the level of remaining function; it is not intended to inquire whether the Veteran should undergo

an amputation with fitting of a prosthesis. For example, if the functions of grasping (hand) or propulsion (foot) are as limited as if the Veteran had an amputation and

prosthesis, the examiner should check "yes" and describe the diminished functioning. The question simply asks whether the functional loss is to the same degree as

if there were an amputation of the affected limb.
11A. Due to the ALS condition, is there functional impairment of an extremity such that no effective function remains other than that which would be equally well

served by an amputation with prosthesis? (Functions of the upper extremity include grasping, manipulation, etc., while functions for the lower extremity include

balance and propulsion, etc.)
Yes, functioning is so diminished that amputation with prothesis would equally serve the Veteran

No

11B. If "Yes," indicate extremity(ies) (Check all extremities for which this applies)
Right upper

Left upper

Right lower

Left lower

(For each checked extremity, describe loss of effective function, identify the condition causing loss of function, and provide specific examples) (brief summary):

SECTION XII - FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY
12A. In your judgment, is the Veteran able to manage his or her benefit payments in his or her own best interest, or able to direct someone else to do so?
Yes
No

(If "No," provide rationale):
SECTION XIV - FUNCTIONAL IMPACT
14A. Does the Veteran's ALS impact his or her ability to work?
Yes
No

(If "Yes," describe the impact of the Veteran's ALS, providing one or more examples)
